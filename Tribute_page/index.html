        <h4> Vargas's Legacy </h4>
     </div>
        <p id="legacy"> When learning about Brazil's history there are many important names to note, from emperors, to former slaves. However, there is one, that arguably, stands out from the rest, his name, is Getulio Vargas. 
    <p>
      <div id="tribute">
      <p id="tribute-info"> While many democratic achievements happened during his rule, like the right for women to participate in the national elections, the right to secret vote (ending the common practice of the elite manipulating the people's vote) and the CLT, a declaration of worker's rights, during the <i>Estado Novo</i> regime, Vargas was responsible for antisemitic, anticomunnist and ultranationalist legislations. Therefore, seizing the people's basic right to freedom of expression and thought. </p>

       <p id="final"> Many people consider Getulio Vargas just a dictator that represented opression, others think he was the greatest leader Brazil ever had. One thing is for sure, he was responsile for shaping what would, in the future, become modern Brazil. If you want to know more about his life, I reccomend <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Getulio-Vargas" target="_blank">reading this article</a> .</p>
